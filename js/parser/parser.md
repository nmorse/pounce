# Parsing Pounce
Concatenative languages go easy on parsers. (so far) The Pounce parser has not needed any lookaheads and the AST is really just a list.

 * `Pounce_ast.peg` is the grammar that parses Pounce
 * `Pounce_ast.js` is generated by the parser generator (canopy)[http://canopy.jcoglan.com]
 * `Pounce_ast_actions.js` is a set of helper 'actions' that are used at parse time to make a Pounce AST (a.k.a. program list)

to generate the parser and test it:
> canopy Pounce_ast.peg --lang js
> node Pounce_ast_tester.js
